# Microlab 3D Printed Reactors

![Four Thieves Vinegar Micro Lab](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab/blob/master/images/4tvc.jpg)

This repository  where you can find the STL files for the 3D printed MicroLab printed reactors. The software for the MicroLab reactor can be found here: https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab. The provided versions of the Von Hippel-series reactors are `v0.5` and `v0.6`, with folders organized by their version.

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.5/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.5` reactor: a three-piece 3D printed reactor which emphasizes using easy-to-find, off-the-shelf components.

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.6/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.6` reactor: a single-piece 3D printed reactor which requires a much larger printed piece, but is without the need for other components.

The design of the reactor is ongoing and future versions will be made available here.
