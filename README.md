# MicroLab 3D Printed Reactors

![Four Thieves Vinegar Micro Lab](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab/blob/master/images/4tvc.jpg)

This repository contains STL files for the MicroLab 3D printed reactors. The software for the MicroLab reactor can be found here: https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab. The provided versions of the Von Hippel-series reactors are `v0.5` and `v0.6`, with folders organized by their version.

## Reactor Versions

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.5/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.5` reactor: a three-piece 3D printed reactor which emphasizes using easy-to-find, off-the-shelf components.

The `VON_HIPPEL_REACTOR_v0.6/` directory contains STL files for the `v0.6` reactor: a single-piece 3D printed reactor which requires a much larger printed piece, but is without the need for other components.

The design of the reactor is ongoing and future versions will be made available here as they are released.
